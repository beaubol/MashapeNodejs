This is a sample nodejs script to access Mashape using REST.  It's accessing the bitly API.

You would need to put in a Mashape authorization header to get this to work.  For that, you need to sign up for a Mashape account at http://www.mashape.com/ 

You can get the header from the Mashape REST docs at https://www.mashape.com/docs/consume/rest

(My bitly key is already there because you're lazy :P)

Send your questions to chris@mashape.com.  Enjoy!
